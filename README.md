# Dreamrecipes

For this project to showcase my skills as a fullstack developer I created a simple cookbook/recipe website using Flask. Since it is web-based it can always be loaded quickly and it can be just a bookmark away!
 
## UX
 
On the homepage I implemented a recently added recipes view for users to stay up to date. Through the search function and quick navigation users can quickly find the recipe they are looking for. Adding & deleting recipes is done quickly through the webform or the settings page respectively.

## Features

This web apps current features include:
 
### Existing Features
- Register as a user through a webform
- Login with known sign in information
- Settings page to change email/password/name/phonenumber or delete phonenumber and the option to delete uploaded recipes
- Search function to search recipes based on description
- Option to add recipes through a webform
- Quick navigation bar to switch to all recipes of a selected base ingredient
- view full recipe description/view

### Features Left to Implement
- Future proof user/login system
- Expand search function to include search in titles/instructions
- Rework new recipe form & recipe view to improve visibility
- Comments/like system on recipes

## Technologies Used

In this project I used Python Flask to build a responsive HTML5 website. Data is stored in a MongoDB database, which is accessed through python. Styling is done with the openbootrstrap/bootstrap theme through CSS3 & JS. 

### Libraries used
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) & openbootrstrap.
    - This project uses Bootstrap for styling and grid layout.
- Python
    - Python dependencies can be found in the requirements.txt file

## Testing

For testing I used Chrome developer tools to check if the layout stayed consistent and comfortable on multiple screensizes and mobile devices. Followed all user flows on the website to confirm functionality as expected.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on Heroku
